# EmployeeList
Application developed in Java and XML, using Android Studio.
You need to introduce your own Google API key and Google Custom Search Engine ID in order to use the custom search engine on google.com.

Application adds the employees of a company and their details related to date of birth, salary, gender. The data is displayed on the main screen(using a recyclerview), along with analytics related to age, gender and salary. With a click on the employee views in the main screen, the user is taken to a new screen where he/she can make a custom search (by employee name). The search will return headers of top 5 hits on google.com.

Tools & ideas included: Butterknife, Room Database, Recyclerview, Material Design, Executor with Callable function, Period function for age calculation, number rounding, List Comparator, Gender ratio calculation.

By "production ready" I assume that an app gets a successful build -> code needs to be error free and tested for bugs, and therefore it is capable of meeting the demands of its users.
